print("Hello, World!")

#first Commit

#The first day of learning python consisted of learning about the print function, concatenating values using the + sign
# and doubling values using the * sign. We also can print characters from a string using the syntax varvalue [Starting Value:Ending Value: Step Value]
#You can use negative values to go in reverse order.

#Review of Day 1
print("Hello, Hector")

FirstNameVariable = ("Hector")
LastNameVariable = (" Zaragoza")

ConcatStr = FirstNameVariable + LastNameVariable
print(ConcatStr)

print(ConcatStr [7::2]) #start at character 7, print, go two steps, print, until end.
